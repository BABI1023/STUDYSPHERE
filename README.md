## ✨ Why I Built This

As a student preparing for the *Google STEP Internship*, I built this project to solve a real need: managing my DSA prep, task list, motivational content, and certificate tracking all in one place. It’s now part of my resume and GitHub portfolio to show my front-end skills and problem-solving mindset. 💡🌟
